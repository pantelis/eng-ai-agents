    "The goal of this post/notebook is to go from the basics of data preprocessing to modern techniques used in machine learning. My point is that we can use code (Python/Numpy etc.) to better understand abstract mathematical notions! Thinking by coding! 💥\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with basic but very useful concepts in data science and machine learning learning like variance and covariance matrix and we will go further to some preprocessing techniques used to feed images into neural networks. We will try to get more concrete insights using code to actually see what each equation is doing!\n",
    "\n",
    "We call preprocessing all transformations on the raw data before it is fed to the machine learning algorithm. For instance, training a convolutional neural network on raw images will probably lead to bad classification performances ([Pal & Sumachine, 2016](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7808140/)). The preprocessing is also important to speed up training (for instance, centering and scaling techniques, see [Lecun et al., 2012; see 4.3](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98b.pdf)).\n",

    "1. **Background**: In the first part, we will get some reminders about variance and covariance and see how to generate and plot fake data to get a better understanding of these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing**: In the second part, we will see the basics of some preprocessing techniques that can be applied to any kind of data: mean normalization, standardisation and whitening.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Whitening images**: In the third part, we will use the tools and concepts gained in 1. and 2. to do a special kind of whitening called Zero Component Analysis (ZCA). It can be used to preprocess images for machine learning. This part will be very practical and fun ☃️!\n",

A negative covariance means the opposite: large values from one variable are associated with small values of the other. The covariance value depends on the scale of the variable so it is hard to analyse it. It is possible to use the correlation coefficient that is easier to interpret.

    "Another way to do it is to take each of the 3072 pixels that we have (32 by 32 pixels for R, G and B) for every image and subtract the mean of that pixel across all images. This is called per-pixel mean subtraction. This time, each pixel will be centered around 0 *according to all images*. When you will feed your network with the images, each pixel is considered as a different feature. With the per-pixel mean subtraction, we have centered each feature (pixel) around 0. This technique is commonly used (e.g [Wan et al., 2013](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/wan13.html)).\n",

    "We will now do the per-pixel mean subtraction from our 1000 images. Our data are organized with these dimensions (images, pixels). It was (1000, 3072) because there are 1000 images with $32 \\times 32 \\times 3 = 3072$ pixels. The mean per-pixel can thus be obtained from the first axis:"
