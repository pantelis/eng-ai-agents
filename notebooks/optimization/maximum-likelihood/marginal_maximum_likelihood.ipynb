    "Most of the models in supervised machine learning are estimated using the ML principle. In this section we introduce the principle and outline the objective function of the ML estimator that has wide applicability in many learning tasks.  Assume that we have $m$ examples drawn from a data generator that generates the vectors $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{X}$ _independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)_ according to some unknown (but fixed) probability distribution function $p_{data}(\\mathbf{x})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{X} = \\{ \\mathbf{x}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}_m \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $p_{model}(\\mathbf x, \\mathbf w)$ a parametric family of probability distributions (our hypothesis set) over the same space that attempts to approximate (model) $p_{data}(\\mathbf{x})$ as closely as possible using a suitable estimate of the parameter vector $\\mathbf w$. The ML estimator for $\\mathbf w$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf w_{ML} = \\arg\\max_{\\mathbf w} p_{model}(\\mathbb X; \\mathbf w)$$\n",
    "$$ = \\arg\\max_{\\mathbf w} \\prod_{i=1}^m p_{model}(\\mathbf x^{(i)}; \\mathbf w)$$\n",
    "$$ = \\arg\\max_{\\mathbf w} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log p_{model}(\\mathbf x^{(i)}; \\mathbf w)$$\n",
    "$$ = \\arg\\max_{\\mathbf w} \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log p_{model}(\\mathbf x^{(i)}; \\mathbf w)$$\n",
    "$$ = \\arg\\max_{\\mathbf w} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim \\hat p_{data}} \\log p_{model}(\\mathbf x; \\mathbf w)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the last expression it is evident that in ML estimation two distributions are involved: $\\hat p_{data}$ and $p_{model}$. We can also make use of our intuition that a good estimator would minimize the distance between the two empirical distributions therefore the KL divergence:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$KL( \\hat p_{data} || p_{model} ) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf x  \\sim \\hat p_{data}} \\left[\\log \\hat p_{data}(\\mathbf x) - \\log p_{model}(\\mathbf x, \\mathbf w) \\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1st term is independent of the model and therefore we see that the KL and the ML estimator expressions are _identical_ except from the sign. Therefore we conclude that _minimizing KL divergence, maximizes the likelihood function_. From information theory we know that the KL divergence and  the cross entropy (CE) are related via the expression\n",
    "\n",
    "$$CE = H(\\hat p_{data}, p_{model}) = KL( \\hat p_{data} || p_{model} ) + H(\\hat p_{data})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that $\\hat p_{data}$ is given in supervised learning, $H(\\hat p_{data})$ is constant and therefore we can conclude that in this case, CE is equivalent to the KL i.e. **minimizing the KL divergence, is equivalent in minimizing cross-entropy (CE)**. Therefore the expression the only need to minimize which we will call the CE cost function (also known as log loss) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(\\mathbf w) = CE = - \\mathbb{E_{\\mathbf x \\sim \\hat p_{data}}}  \\log p_{model}(\\mathbf x, \\mathbf w)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross entropy is a very generic objective (loss) function that is applicable to any _supervised learning_ problem that uses maximum likelihood to estimate a model.  "

    "Assume now that someone is giving us an array of values and ask us to estimate a $p_{model}$ that is a 'good fit' to the gievn data. How we can go about solving this problem with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)? Notice that as addressed in [3], probability and likelihood have a reverse relationship.

The likelihood function gives the relative likelihoods of different values for the parameter(s) of the distribution from which the data are assumed to have been drawn, given those data.\n",
