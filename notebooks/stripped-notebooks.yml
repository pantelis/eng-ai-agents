# Stripped Notebooks Registry
# This file tracks all notebooks that have been stripped of markdown cells
# for public release in the eng-ai-agents repository.
#
# When converting aiml-common notebooks to MDX, always run the strip skill
# and add the stripped notebook here.

# Use "---" as a separator between topic groups.
